# Sums of Perfect Squares

## Description

The task is simply stated. Given an integer `n` (`3 < n < 10`<sup>`9`</sup>), find the length of the smallest list of perfect squares which add up to n. Come up with the best algorithm you can; you'll need it!

### Examples

* `sum_of_squares(17) = 2`
17 = 16 + 1 (4 and 1 are perfect squares).
* `sum_of_squares(15) = 4`
15 = 9 + 4 + 1 + 1. There is no way to represent 15 as the sum of three perfect squares.
* `sum_of_squares(16) = 1`
16 itself is a perfect square.

## Time constraints

5 easy (sample) test cases: `n < 20`

5 harder test cases: `1000 < n < 15000`

5 maximally hard test cases: `5 * 1e`<sup>`8`</sup>` < n < 1e`<sup>`9`</sup>

15 random maximally hard test cases: `1e`<sup>`8`</sup>` < n < 1e`<sup>`9`</sup>
