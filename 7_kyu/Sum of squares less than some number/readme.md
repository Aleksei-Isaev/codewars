# Sum of squares less than some number

## Description

Write a function `get_number_of_squares` that will return how many integer (starting from 1, 2...) numbers raised to power of 2 and then summed up are less than some number given as a parameter.

## Examples

* For n = 6 result should be 2 because 1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> = 1 + 4 = 5 and 5 < 6.

* For n = 15 result should be 3 because 1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14 and 14 < 15.
