# Stacked Balls - 2D

## Background

I have stacked some pool balls in a triangle.

Like this,

## Kata Task

Given the number of `layers` of my stack, what is the total height?

Return the height as multiple of the ball diameter.

### Example

The image above shows a stack of 5 layers.

### Notes

* `layers` >= 0
* approximate answers (within 0.001) are good enough
