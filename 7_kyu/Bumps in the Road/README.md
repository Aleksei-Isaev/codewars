# Bumps in the Road

## Description

Your car is old, it breaks easily. The shock absorbers are gone and you think it can handle about `15` more bumps before it dies totally.

Unfortunately for you, your drive is very bumpy! Given a string showing either flat road (`"_"`) or bumps (`"n"`), work out if you make it home safely. `15` bumps or under, return `"Woohoo!"`, over `15` bumps return `"Car Dead"`.

Note: to run the test, create a virtual environment and install codewar's testing framework (currently release v0.2.0):

`$ python -m pip install git+https://github.com/codewars/python-test-framework.git@ba881f9221f9086e97ec6f7baf43722bc5fbbe5b`

and you can run it with:

`$ python -m unittest`

in python directory.
