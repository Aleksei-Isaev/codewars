# Find the GCF of Two Numbers

## Description

Your task here is the find the GCF ([Greatest Common Factor](http://www.math.com/school/subject1/lessons/S1U3L2GL.html)) of any two numbers passed into a method, which will return one integer answer as an output.

###Â Examples

```python
find_GCF(4, 6) # Should return 2
find_GCF(93, 186) # Should return 93
find_GCF(20, 5) # Should return 5
```

Here, inputs will always be natural numbers so there's no need to worry about negative values or zero.
