# Monotone travel

##Â Description

Peter lives on a hill, and he always moans about the way to his home. "_It's always just up. I never get a rest_". But you're pretty sure that at least at one point Peter's altitude doesn't rise, but fall. To get him, you use a nefarious plan: you attach an altimeter to his backpack and you read the data from his way back at the next day.

## Task

You're given a list of compareable elements:

```python
heights = [Integers or Floats]
```

Your job is to check whether for any `x` all successors are greater or equal to `x`.

```python
is_monotone([1,2,3]) == True
is_monotone([1,1,2]) == True
is_monotone([1])     == True
is_monotone([3,2,1]) == False
is_monotone([3,2,2]) == False
```

If the list is empty, Peter has probably removed your altimeter, so we cannot prove him wrong and he's still right:

```python
is_monotone([])     == True
```

Such a sequence is also called _monotone_ or _[monotonic sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function)_, hence the name `isMonotone`.
