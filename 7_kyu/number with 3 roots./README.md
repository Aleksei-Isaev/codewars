# number with 3 roots.

## Description

In mathematics, an n<sup>th</sup> root of a number `x`, where `n` is usually assumed to be a positive integer, is a number `r` which, when raised to the power `n`, yields `x`:

> r <sup>n</sup> = x,

Given number `n`, such that `n > 1`, find if its 2<sup>nd</sup> root, 4<sup>th</sup> root and 8<sup>th</sup> root are all integers (fractional part is `0`), return `true` if it exists, `false` if not.

```python
# 2nd root of 256 is 16
# 4th root of 256 is 4
# 8th root of 256 is 2
perfect_roots(256) # returns True
```
