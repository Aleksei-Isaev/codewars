# Isograms

## Description

An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

```python
is_isogram("Dermatoglyphics" ) == True
is_isogram("aba" ) == False
is_isogram("moOse" ) == False # -- ignore letter case
```
