# SQL Basics: Create a FUNCTION

##Â Description

For this challenge you need to create a basic increment function which increments on the age field of the peoples table.

The function should be called `increment`, it needs to take 1 integer and increment that number by 1.

You may query the people table while testing but the query must only contain the function on your final submit.

*+`people table schema`**

* `id`
* `name`
* `age`
