# Person Class Bug

##Â Description

The following code was thought to be working properly, however when the code tries to access the age of the person instance it fails.

```python
person = Person('Yukihiro', 'Matsumoto', 47)
print(person.full_name)
print(person.age)
```

For this exercise you need to fix the code so that it works correctly.
