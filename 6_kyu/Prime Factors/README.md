# Prime Factors

_(Inspired by one of [Uncle Bob's TDD Kata](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.ThePrimeFactorsKata))_

Write a function that generates factors for a given number.

The function takes an `integer` on the standard input and returns a list of integers (ObjC: array of `NSNumbers` representing integers). That list contains the prime factors in numerical sequence.

###Â Examples

```python
1  ==>  []
3  ==>  [3]
8  ==>  [2, 2, 2]
9  ==>  [3, 3]
12 ==>  [2, 2, 3]
```
