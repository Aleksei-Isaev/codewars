# Tortoise racing

##Â Description

Two tortoises named _**A**_ and _**B**_ must run a race. A starts with an average speed of `720 feet per hour`. Young _**B**_ knows she runs faster than _**A**_, and furthermore has not finished her cabbage.

When she starts, at last, she can see that _**A**_ has a `70 feet lead` but _**B**_'s speed is `850 feet per hour`. How long will it take _**B**_ to catch _**A**_?

More generally: given two speeds `v1` (_**A**_'s speed, integer > 0) and `v2` (_**B**_'s speed, integer > 0) and a lead `g` (integer > 0) how long will it take _**B**_ to catch _**A**_?

The result will be an array `[hour, min, sec]` which is the time needed in hours, minutes and seconds (round down to the nearest second) or a string in some languages.

If `v1 >= v2` then return `nil`, `nothing`, `null`, `None` or `{-1, -1, -1}` for C++, C, Go, Nim, Pascal, `[-1, -1, -1]` for Perl,`[]` for Kotlin or "-1 -1 -1".

### Examples

_(form of the result depends on the language)_

```go
race(720, 850, 70) => [0, 32, 18] or "0 32 18"
race(80, 91, 37)   => [3, 21, 49] or "3 21 49"
```

### Note

* See other examples in "Your test cases".

* In Fortran - as in any other language - the returned string is not permitted to contain any redundant trailing whitespace: you can use dynamically allocated character strings.

_** Hints for people who don't know how to convert to hours, minutes, seconds:_

* Tortoises don't care about fractions of seconds.
* Think of calculation by hand using only integers (in your code use or simulate integer division).
* or Google: "convert decimal time to hours minutes seconds".
