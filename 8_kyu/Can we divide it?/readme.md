# Can we divide it

## Description

Your task is to create function `isDivideBy` (or `is_divide_by`) to check if an integer number is divisible by each out of two arguments.

A few cases:

```python
(-12, 2, -6)  ->  True
(-12, 2, -5)  ->  False

(45, 1, 6)    ->  False
(45, 5, 15)   ->  True

(4, 1, 4)     ->  True
(15, -5, 3)   ->  True
```
