# For UFC Fans (Total Beginners): Conor McGregor vs George Saint Pierre

##Â Description

This is a beginner friendly kata especially for [UFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship)/[MMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts) fans.

It's a fight between the two legends: [Conor McGregor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor) vs [George Saint Pierre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_St-Pierre) in Madison Square Garden. Only one fighter will remain standing, and after the fight in an interview with [Joe Rogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan) the winner will make his legendary statement. It's your job to return the right statement depending on the winner!

If the winner is **George Saint Pierre** he will obviously say:

* _"I am not impressed by your performance."_

If the winner is **Conor McGregor** he will most undoubtedly say:

* _"I'd like to take this chance to apologize.. To absolutely NOBODY!"_

Good Luck!
