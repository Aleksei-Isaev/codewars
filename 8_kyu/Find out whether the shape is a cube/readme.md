# Find out whether the shape is a cube

## Description

To find the volume (centimeters cubed) of a cuboid you use the formula:

`volume = Length * Width * Height`

But someone forgot to use proper record keeping, so we only have the volume, and the length of a single side!

It's up to you to find out whether the cuboid has equal sides (= is a cube).

Return `True` if the cuboid could have equal sides, return `False` otherwise.

Return `False` for invalid numbers too (e.g volume or side is less than or equal to 0).

*Note: the sides must be integers.*
